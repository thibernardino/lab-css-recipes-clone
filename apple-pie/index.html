        <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. 
        I have never seen another one quite like it. 
        It will always be my favourite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. 
        I hope it becoms one of your favourites as well.

        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F(220 degrees C). 
          Melt the butter in a saucepan. 
          Stir in flour to form a paste. 
          Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. 
          Reduce temperature and let simmer. </li>
        <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. 
          Fill with apples, mounded slightly. 
          Cover with a lattice work crust. 
          Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. 
          Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
